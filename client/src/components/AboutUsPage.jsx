              Smoothies Organic Juice Bar At Sip, you are consuming the highest
              quality, organic and plant-based foods available to us. We partner
              with multiple local farms, bringing in fresh produce several times
              a week. Use the guide below to help you understand our
              commitments. Plant-Based Plant-based foods are easily digestible,
              providing immediate energy. They are free of animal products and
              by-products. Organic Organic foods are grown without the use of
              chemical pesticides and Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs).
              Calories Did you know that calorie is another word for energy?
              Calories fuel our bodies, and the most selective we are with the
              quality and quantity, the better our bodies will perform. Eating
              just enough and including lots of plants is a good start to a
              healthy body.
